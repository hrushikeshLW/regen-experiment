## 🎨 CSS Updates

**File:** `/src/modules/dashboard/styles/dashboard.css`

Updated selectors to work with react-share icons:

```css
/* react-share Icon Styles */
.share-menu-item svg {
  transition: transform 0.2s ease;
}

.modern-share-menu .ant-dropdown-menu-item:hover .share-menu-item svg {
  transform: scale(1.1);
}
```

Hover effects still work:
- ✅ Background tint in platform color
- ✅ Slide 4px to right
- ✅ Icon scales on hover
- ✅ Text becomes bolder
- ✅ Left border accent

## 🔧 How It Works

### Share Flow:

1. **User clicks "Share" in widget menu**
   - Opens dropdown with 3 platforms

2. **User selects platform** (e.g., WhatsApp)
   - Triggers `onShare(SHARE_PLATFORMS.WHATSAPP)`

3. **Export hook generates file**
   - Creates PDF/CSV/Image based on widget type

4. **shareHandler downloads file**
   - File downloads to user's device

5. **Platform-specific action**
   - **WhatsApp:** Opens `https://web.whatsapp.com/send?text=...` (desktop) or `whatsapp://send?text=...` (mobile)
   - **Email:** Opens `mailto:?subject=...&body=...` with pre-filled template
   - **Telegram:** Opens `https://t.me/share/url?text=...`

6. **Success notification**
   - Toast: "Widget shared successfully"
